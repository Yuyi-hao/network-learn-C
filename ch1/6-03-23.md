# <center>Introduction</center> 
- Networking -> connecting various digital device to communicate and to share resources. 
- Protocols -> Standards define to communicate over internet.\
                 e.g. - voltage in ethernet, how jpeg compressed to show on web page.
- While communication, many problems arises as in whom to send , what method  use to send , error correction , etc.
- These questions are treated as problems in communication and each of it is dealt at different layer.
- The way all these layers are dealt and defined as a whole structure is called a network model.

## OSI(Open System Interconnection) model
- standardized in 1977, published in ISO 7498(International Organization for Standardization)
- Layers in OSI model 

| Layer name | Functions |
|------------|-----------|
|Application layer | User interface e.g -> web browser, email services etc. |
|Presentation layer | Defining data structure, Encoding, Encryption, data representation| 
| Session layer | Establishing, Suspend, Resume, Checkpoints terminal dialogs |
| Transport layer | Provide TCP/UDP, Splitting of data, Recombining them, orders of data packets, also responsible for process to process delivery |
| Network layer | Transmit the data between node and network. Here IP(Internet protocol) is defined |
| Data Link layer | Deals with the protocol, Define how a direct message between two nodes, framing, error detection/correction |
| Physical layer | Deals with the real world transmission hardware specification e.g. -> voltage in ethernet cable, frequency of wifi, flashes over an optical fiber|

 >> **NOTE:**\
    Chunks are called :
    1. Frame -> At data link layer 
    2. packet -> At Network layer
    3. Segment -> At Transport layer(TCP)
    4. Datagram -> AT Transport layer(UDP) 

## TCP/IP(Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) Layer model
- The TCP/IP model is a conceptual model that describes how data is transmitted over a network, and it is widely used as the basis for modern communication networks.

> **🖊️** -> TCP/IP reference model was developed after the TCP/IP protocols already in common use. 

```
🔷
The OSI model is better for understanding and reasoning about networking concerns, but the TCP/IP model reflects a more realistic view of how networking is commonly implemented today.
```
- Layers

| Layer Name | Function |
|------------|----------|
|Network Access layer | Physical connection, data framing, sending ethernet or wifi packets |
|Internet layer | Addressing packets and routing them over the network, this is where IP addresses are defined |
|Host-to-Host layer | Provide protocols(e.g. -> UDP, TCP), data order, data segmentation, network congestion, error detection/correction |
| Process/Application layer | Here protocols are implemented(e.g. -> SMTP, FTP, HTTP, etc.), user interface|

> Lower level provided by operating system we work mostly in Process/Application layer

## Data encapsulation
- To make an application we only need to consider high-level protocols.
- For example, a web browser needs only to implement the protocols dealing specifically with websites—HTTP, HTML, CSS, and so on. It does not need to bother with implementing TCP/IP, and it certainly doesn't have to understand how an Ethernet or Wi-Fi packet is encoded. It can rely on ready-made implementations of the lower layers for these tasks. These implementations are provided by the operating system (for example, Windows, Linux, and macOS).

## Internet Protocol(IP)
- Network protocol define Rules for transmitting, receiving and processing data over a network.
- IP stands for "Internet Protocol". It is a network protocol that is responsible for routing data packets between devices on the internet or other IP-based networks
- Two version of IP:-
  1. IPV4 - 32-bit unsigned integer(0-65535) address provided be ISP(Internet service provider).
  2. IPV6 - 128-bit unsigned intege, standardized by IETF(Internet Engineering Task Force).
- Modern device support both IPV4 and IPV6 its callled dual-stack configuration.

### IP addresses
#### IPV4
- All internet protocol traffic route to an address.
- IPV4 32-bit long & divided into 4 1-byte section seperated by **.** or decimal.
- **Loopback** -> A special address (127.0.0.1) is reserved to establish connection with myself or itself.
	- OS short circuit this address so that packets to it never enter the network but instead stay local to the OS.
	IPV6 loopback -> ::1

#### IPV6
- 8-group of 4-hexadecimal character seperated by colon(**:**).
- To represent hexadecimal use lowrcase character. 
- **Shorthand**\ 
	1. Avoid leading zeros. e.g. -> 0def == def 
	2. consecutive set of zeros replaced with `::`. e.g. -> 0000:0000:1 == ::1
- An IPV6 address can be map with an IPV4 address.
- IPV6 provide scope and lifetime 
- Also eliminate the need of Network Address Translation(NAT) in router
#### Link local address 
- Link local addresses are usabale only on the local link. Router never forward packets from these addresses. They are useful for system to access auto-configuration function before having an IP address.

## Domain name 
- Name for an IP address e.g. -> example.com 
- Mapping of domain name to IP is done by DNS(Domain Name System)
- IP address for a domain name server is usually assigned by ISP(Internet service provider)
### To resolve a hostname 
- Computer sends UDP message to DNS and ask for AAAA-type record for the domain.
- If it exist an IPV6 address is return else computer ask for A-type record if exist return an IPV4 address.
- Then connect to server at that address to load the site
